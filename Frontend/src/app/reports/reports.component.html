<p class="card-text">The chart above illustrates the fact that generative AI innovations do not make the technology any more effective but also decrease the cost of using it. With models becoming increasingly efficient through LoRA and quantization, AI use could be implemented more economically by enterprises in healthcare and e-commerce industries, adding more depth to their operations. The decline in their costs is likely to accelerate its penetration into more verticals and democratize access to AI solutions.</p>
